    <p>This is a online car rental center that allows you to browse our selection of cars<br>
    and rent them for a certain number of days. The rental car is booked from the date<br>
    of booking for the amount of days specified by the user. From the main browsing page,<br>
    adding to the cart will mean it is booked for a day only - you must click on the car<br>
    to specify how many days you would like to book it for.<p>
