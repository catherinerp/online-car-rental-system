        This is a online car rental center that allows you to browse our selection of cars
        and rent them for a certain number of days. The rental car is booked from the date
        of booking for the amount of days specified by the user. From the main browsing page,
        adding to the cart will mean it is booked for a day only - you must click on the car
        to specify how many days you would like to book it for. More details about the car can
        be viewed by clicking 'Details' when hovering over the car.<br>
        Details such as:
        <ul>
            <li>Make</li>
            <li>Model</li>
            <li>Year</li>
            <li>Body Type</li>
            <li>Mileage</li>

        As you checkout, the required payment amount will be displayed and it <b>must</b> be paid 
        upfront. You are able to view your rental booking history under 'Account' and you can choose
        to cancel it. Cancelling your booking does mean forfeiting your deposit. Cars are provided
        with a full tank - on the last day of your booking, all rented vehicles must return in the
        same condition with a full tank. Compensation for fuel costs will not be provided.
