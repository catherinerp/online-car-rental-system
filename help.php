        This is a online car rental center that allows you to browse our selection of cars
        and rent them for a certain number of days. The rental car is booked from the date
        of booking for the amount of days specified by the user. From the main browsing page,
        adding to the cart will mean it is booked for a day only - you must click on the car
        to specify how many days you would like to book it for.
